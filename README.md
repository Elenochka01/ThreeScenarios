### ThreeScenarios
---  
### Project Description
This project features a Selenium automation script developed in Java to validate the functionality of a sample web application through three distinct test scenarios.

The test cases demonstrate core automation techniques such as locating elements, interacting with form inputs, and using waits to handle dynamic content. Each scenario is designed to simulate a typical user action and validate expected behaviors across the application.

The test scripts highlight the use of various locator strategies including **XPath** and **CSS Selectors**, showcasing flexibility in identifying web elements. `WebDriverWait` is applied to ensure reliable interaction with dynamic elements. One of the scripts also includes `Thread.sleep` to provide visible delays for easier step-by-step observation during test video recording.

This project serves as a learning and demonstration resource for fundamental UI automation skills using **Selenium WebDriver** in a Java environment.
